                We strive for precision and relevance in our analyses. However, it's important to note that Sensopinion relies on artificial intelligence models, which, like any technology, have their limitations. Our results may occasionally be subject to inaccuracies and can potentially 'hallucinate' in categorization, emotion classification, and sentiment classification. We continuously work on improving our models for better accuracy and reliability.
