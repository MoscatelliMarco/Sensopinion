                At the core of Sensopinion is a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model. This AI is the driving force behind our ability to categorize, evaluate, and interpret vast amounts of news data. It's designed to understand and process language much like a human, but with the speed and efficiency of a machine.

            <p class="text-sm text-grey-2">
                We strive for precision and relevance in our analyses. However, it's important to note that Sensopinion relies on artificial intelligence models, which, like any technology, have their limitations. Our results may occasionally be subject to inaccuracies and can potentially 'hallucinate' in categorization, emotion classification, and sentiment classification. We continuously work on improving our models for better accuracy and reliability.
